## Overview 
This objective of this game is to go head-to-head with another player to see who can pop the most balloons, obtaining the highest score in a limited time. The vision is for this to be a fast-paced, completive experience where tensions are high as you compete for the most points in the short time frame. 
## Game Mechanics 
#### Player Controls 
- Joystick - Crosshair Movement 
	- Crosshair is used to indicate where the player will shoot
	- Essentially the player's "character"
- Buttons - Shooting Dart 
#### Timer
- There is a 3 second countdown before the game starts officially 
	- This give a chance for players to get mentally ready to play 
	- This also gives the player time to get acquainted with the controls  
- 30 second timer during gameplay 
	- This keeps gameplay fast-paced and quick
	- This helps create the tension as your time is short leaving little room for error 
	- At the timer end is when the winner is decided 
#### Balloons/Point System 
- Balloons appear at random over the course of the round 
- Popping the balloons earns you points 
	- Each player will gain 1 point per balloon they pop
- The player with the most points wins the game
